keeping this public:
- so i can git clone to my desktop

errors:
- fuck with ariadne
- generalize diagnostics to be at any stage
- figure out when the emitter will error out

lexer: basically nothing.
- determine if any other types of errors are needed
- determine if any other types of tokens are desired (or not desired, starting small is lowk better)

parser:
- decide nom, chumsky, rust-peg, or LALRPOP

emitter:
- i assume this is just a matter of take ast, form into proper arguments, write to file.
- this and the vm step are interlocked. build a vm step, write emitter for it, test.

vm:
- double check naming
- start taking in opcode based instructions (which most should be duplicatable) packed into u32s
- this should only do the execution. the frontend should handle cemantics and packing. remove some instruction based shit
